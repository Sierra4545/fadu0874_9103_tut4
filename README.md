## Name of project
### [Simulation of water lily life cycle](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/explore/66f3a461000000001b023a8d?xsec_token=ABXfSaYzubDp4K8m1RBgdSHpuKzGiM_-ZFHZKIkumSv80=&xsec_source=pc_user)


**descriptionï¼š**  
This project focuses on the dynamic presentation of the life cycle of water lilies, including their growth, flowering, and interaction with the environment.

**Why it inspired me:**  
This project creates dynamic images in a three-dimensional form. Through code, it uses ellipse and water lily animations to change over time. It is very vital and artistic. I hope that my code can also show a kind of growth and change.
